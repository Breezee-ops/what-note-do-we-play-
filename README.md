# what-note-do-we-play-
A simple implementation to find strangest frequency from a mic input using fourier transform.

TO DO for project AVAJ:
1) <s>use strongest frequency</s> to correlate to note to be played.
2) hardware implementation.
3) if possible, write code to understand multiple strongest notes and subsequent hardware implementation to play said notes.
